# memeISP Puppet Data

Within is the data related to the deployment of Brody Stockels memeISP, as shown @ AusNOG 2022

- `hieradata/` : The puppet Hiera data containing the configurations of the deployment
- `dhcpv6_interfaceid.patch` : A patch for accel-ppp to conform to the Australian NBN way of doing DHCPv6 on their NEBS platform. (This patch will apply to accel-ppp as of commit 61ba3af1d1e204df000fd78add1dbe1139eb5df7)

The Puppet manifest data can be obtained from me if you would like it as well, just reach out during the Conference, or via linkedin / twitter / email after the fact.

Thanks,

Brody Stockel - <brody@stockel.id.au>
